To avoid conflict, the Institute of Public Affairs confined itself to local, state, regional, and national issues until after the Institute of Politics was discontinued, whereupon the Institute began to employ discussions of foreign affairs. The Institute initially convened each summer for two weeks, usually between the months of June and July. Later, the length of the program was shortened to one week. The Institute met annually from 1927 until 1942, when it was temporarily discontinued due to the exigencies of the war.

So what activities should be undertaken to improve preservation of past radio broadcasts? I think foremost would be tapping the radio-aircheck collector network, which is huge. Here I am talking about the home tapers and not so much the \"Old-time Radio Clubs\" as the Old-Time-Radio folks tend to trade in well documented material (but as individuals they may also have unique, undocumented material).
