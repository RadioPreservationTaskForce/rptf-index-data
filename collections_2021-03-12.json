The Archive is one of the top four collections of African musical heritage in existence. Leo Sarkisian embraced the full spectrum of African musical practices. Leo’s recordings include not only traditional forms of music, but popular music (ranging from jazz bands to Afro-funk), as well as gospel and African-composed classical music (opera and symphonies). Leo, furthermore, carries the singular credit for being the first ethnomusicologist to train African sound engineers, making possible African-initiated music archiving; this training process was part of his role as US cultural ambassador to newly-independent African nations, to ensure that Africans could carry on the work of documenting and preserving their own musical heritage. The Sarkisian collection contains both Leo’s own field recordings and recordings made by sound engineers he trained across the continent. The Sarkisian collection is both an individual and collective achievement, begun by one person and then enriched by many people. The collection’s value lies, in part, in being a representation of African music that, while organized under one individual, preserves the experiences, skills, and choices of many. In 2012, the Library of Congress inducted Music Time in Africa into the National Registry of Recorded Sound, highlighting the show from 29 July 1973 on the music of Mauritania. The online version of Music Time in Africa provides a first-time listening experience beyond the African continent.
