Packard, Jr. (1899-1985), H '20, served as Professor of Public Speaking in the Department of English at Harvard University and as Director of the Speech Clinic, in conjunction with the Department of Hygiene. As early as 1928-1929, Packard began to clamor for the creation of a library of voices. With the help of his colleague E. K. Rand, he coined the term \"vocarium\" to describe his vision for a place where \"voices can be kept and studied.\" In 1933, his efforts led to the publication by Harvard University Phonograph Records of the first discs in what came to be called the Harvard Vocarium, one of the first poetry/literature recordings labels in the world. One of the authors featured in this preliminary commercial release was Harvard graduate T. S. Eliot, who recorded for Packard during his Charles Eliot Norton lectureship in 1932-33. The recording represents Eliot's first published poetry reading. From 1940, until the university discontinued its affiliation in 1955, the Harvard Vocarium made and, in many cases commercially released, the first (or earliest extant) recordings by Elizabeth Bishop, Randall Jarrell, Robinson Jeffers, Weldon Kees, Robert Lowell, Archibald MacLeish, Marianne Moore, Vladimir Nabokov, Anais Nin, Ezra Pound, Muriel Rukeyser, May Sarton, Robert Penn Warren, and Tennessee Williams. In addition to his commercial venture, Packard actively recorded, commissioned, collected, and created \"a repository of all the voices he could get a hold of, a kind of audio time capsule for posterity,\" according to Vocarium discographer Josephine Packard. These recordings ranged from surgeries to Shakespeare, Haitian-Creole ritual performances to Japanese-language lessons, experimental radio plays to Scottish border-ballads. The breadth of languages he recorded in is equally remarkable—among them, Afrikaans, Catalan, Haitian Creole, Chinese, Danish, French, German, Russian, Sanskrit, Spanish, and Yiddish. Packard found a practical depository and an organically evolving home for his \"vocarium\" in the recently opened Woodberry Poetry Room (then on the top floor of Widener Library), where master recordings were held and two phonograph players were subsequently installed for student use. As Packard later recalled: \"My Vocarium was in there.\" A 1938 Boston Sunday Post article hailed his efforts, announcing that \"Harvard University, one of the most forward universities in the world, is breaking all precedent and founding a library for the voice—the Harvard Vocarium.\" With the Poetry Room’s move to the new Lamont Library in 1949, the \"library service\" (as Packard referred to it) was formalized, and custom-designed consoles were created to facilitate listening by 36 students at a time. During the first four months of the collection’s relocation to Lamont Library, \"students signed for earphones in the Poetry Room over 4,000 times.\" In the course of his 45-year career at Harvard University, Packard taught courses in rhetoric, oratory, \"the oral interpretation of literature,\" radio-broadcasting, and (in his final post at the Harvard Divinity School) the art of sermonizing. His innovative work at the Speech Clinic transformed the lives of students and faculty who sought his assistance for stuttering and other speech impediments. Packard’s recordings were made in a number of venues and makeshift studios across campus, including Holden Chapel, Memorial Hall, the Cruft Memorial Laboratory, the Lamont Forum Room, and the Germanic Museum. Packard retired from Harvard in 1965. He died in Brunswick, Maine, on June 26, 1985. In 2002, the Harvard Vocarium was chosen as a part of the first annual selection of the National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress."},
