It also aired briefly on commercial station KIFZ-AM/Fond du Lac, WI. The one hour program often had a theme, while others sampled new releases and to add context, Snyder would share what then-new releases were reviewed ten years' prior in Downbeat magazine. Program engineering was always the duty of a student in Radio TV Film at UW Oshkosh, where Snyder was the founder of the major and its academic coordinator. NOTE: After his death in 2008, Snyder's jazz collection of recordings, magazines and other material was willed to the UW Oshkosh music department which holds it in a special collection (for info: 920-424-4224 or music@uwosh.edu)", "collectionAccessStatement_txt" : "Contact WRST-FM at 920-424-7427 or UW Oshkosh Radio TV Film at 920-424-3131 for access.", "collectionNotes_txt" : "Weekly radio program featuring jazz recordings and host comments"}
